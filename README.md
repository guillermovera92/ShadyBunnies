# ShadyBunnies
### Asra Nizami and Guillermo Vera

This is an shading assignment for the Interactive Graphics course.

## Design choices
We passed both ramps (specular and diffuse) to the shader at the same time. This allows us to quickly change from one to the other without having to recompile the program.
In order to change from toon shading to photorealistic shading, uncomment line 63 and comment out light 60. Save the file and press 'r' to reload the shaders.
